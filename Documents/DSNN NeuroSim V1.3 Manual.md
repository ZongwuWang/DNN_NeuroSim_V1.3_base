## 1. Introduction

DSNN+NeuroSim is an integrated framework, which is develope in python, to emulate the inference performance of the deep neural networks (DNN) and spiking neural networks (SNN) on the same hardware accelerator based on near-memory computing or in-memory computing architectures. The framework is based on the [NeuroSim V1.3](https://github.com/neurosim/DNN_NeuroSim_V1.3.git). Various device technologies are supported, include SRAM, emerging non-volatile memory (eNVM) based on resistance switching (e.g. RRAM, PCM, STT-MRAM), and ferroelectric FET (FeFET). SRAM is by nature 1-bit per cell, eNVMs and FeFET in this simulator could support either 1-bit or multi-bit per cell. NeuroSim is a circuit-level macro model for benchmarking neuro-inspired architectures (including memory array, peripheral logic, and interconnect routing) in terms of circuit-level performance metrics, such as chip area, latency, dynamic energy and leakage power. With Pytorch wrapper, DSNN+NeuroSim framework can support hierarchical organization from the device level (transistors from 130 nm down to 7 nm, eNVM and FeFET device properties) to the circuit level (periphery circuit modules such as analog-to-digital converters, ADCs), to chip level (tiles of processing-elements built up by multiple sub-arrays, and global interconnect and buffer) and then to the algorithm level (different convolutional neural network topologies), enabling instruction-accurate evaluation on the inference accuracy as well as the circuit-level performance metrics at the run-time of inference.
